            <div class="title2">The club was founded as Dial Square Football Club in 1886 by a group of workers employed by the Dial Square workshop at 
                the Royal Arsenal, an armaments factory in Woolwich, which was then in Kent but was incorporated into London in 1889.
                The club renamed to Royal Arsenal a month later,and its first home was Plumstead Common, though they spent most of their time playing at the Manor Ground. 
                Their first trophies were the Kent Senior Cup and London Charity Cup in 1889–90 and the London Senior Cup in 1890–91; 
                these were the only county association trophies Arsenal won during their time in South East London.
                In 1891, Royal Arsenal became the first London club to turn professional.
            
                Arsenal are the first and only team to go a whole Premier League season unbeaten, winning a golden trophy in 2004. Our longest
                serving manager is Arsene Wenger and highest goalscorer: Thierry Henry.</div>

            <div class="title3">Unlike many pundit's predictions, Arsenal FC have had a fantastic start to the 2022/2023 Premier League season. After eight league matches, Arsenal have cemented their place at the top of the Premier League table.
                Memorable victories against Brentford and Tottenham have shown that they are to be taken very seriously as title challengers.
                The North London Derby played on Saturday, October 1st 2022 was a memorable one for The Gunners. It extends their momentum heading into a busy period this season, 
                with October and November containing many fixtures due to the World Cup break in the middle of the season.</div>
